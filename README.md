# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a bike-sharing system, where bikes are made available for short-term rental, either for a fee or free of charge.
BoomBikes, a major player in the US bike-sharing market, has faced a severe drop in revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As lockdown restrictions are eased, the company is looking to optimize its operations and plan ahead to meet the post-pandemic surge in demand.
The objective here is to build a predictive model to understand the factors that influence bike demand and help BoomBikes strategize accordingly. This model will guide the company in making informed decisions to improve bike availability, meet customer demand, and ensure long-term profitability.
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from an Upgrad-provided dataset, covering various factors that affect daily bike demand.

# Tools and Technologies
Python 3.11
Data Visualization: Seaborn and Matplotlib
Modeling: Statsmodels API for implementing Linear Regression

# Key Insights
The Linear Regression model reveals that factors like temperature, wind speed, and the pre-COVID period had a significant impact on bike demand.
BoomBikes can use these insights to better manage bike availability and prepare for fluctuating demand, ensuring bikes are available when and where they're needed most.

# Special Mentions
This project builds on concepts covered in the Upgrad course and live sessions, which provided a strong foundation in data science and machine learning.
